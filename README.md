# Prisma
This is a full stack app which I built to learn about Prisma.
I recently watched a video from Vercel which says that Next.js and Prisma make frontend developers full stack and 
being a full-stack developer has been my lifelong goal, hence this project.

**The stack used in this video is Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma, PostgreSQL, and GraphQL(a Meta database): Data Modeling**
